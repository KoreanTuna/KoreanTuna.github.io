This repository hosts a plain static site for testing Android App Links.

## App Link

The Android App Link declaration is served from [`.well-known/assetlinks.json`](./.well-known/assetlinks.json).

No build step is requiredâ€”push changes directly to the `main` branch and GitHub Pages will serve them.
